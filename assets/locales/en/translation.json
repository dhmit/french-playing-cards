            "1": "The iconography, taxation, manufacture and uses of playing cards in France underwent substantial changes from 1650 to 1850. By the 1780s, an “Old  Regime” deck of cards had emerged, characterized by the standardization of  face cards, the state's increasing efforts to extract tax revenue from their  producers, their manufacture via the guild system, and the gaming and non-gaming uses  the kings subjects made of new and used decks of cards. The Revolution of 1789, however, temporarily eliminated the card-makers guild and the excise tax levied on cards, and mandated the suppression of kings, queens, and jacks on face cards. By the time of the Directory in the late 1790s, and even more so during the First Empire, Old Regime practices crept back into the design, taxation, and uses of playing cards. At the same time, the technologies of production evolved and the industry consolidated from dozens of manufacturers around the kingdom to a half dozen or so firms. The history of playing cards over these two centuries offers insight into questions of rupture and continuity in French politics, culture, and economics across the revolutionary divide.",

Some workers create the paper stock on which the cards are printed, while others paint the cards and then cut and sort them into decks.  Shopkeepers sell finished decks to well-appointed customers, while cats and dogs cavort in the foreground among the discards from the manufacturing process.  Although the shop looks disorderly, the steps involved in making commercial playing cards were well thought-out and efficient.  Thanks to two later, detailed discussions of the process, we have a good idea of how most playing cards in France were made before the French Revolution."

David returned to the iconography of the Old Regime, but endowed each king, queen, and jack with historically appropriate costumes.

Sometimes the changes were subtle. On the left is a prerevolutionary bookplate produced by the Parisian card-maker and stationer Hugues Chassonnier that features the three biblical kings from the East who bore gifts for the Christ child.  The monarch on the left points to the star in the sky that prompted their journey to Bethlehem.  This nameplate, produced in the last two decades of the Old Regime, served as the Chassonnier shop’s trademark; it may have imitated the sign that hung outside his shop.  On the right is a playing card wrapper manufactured by Chassonnier in the early years of the Revolution.  Here the three figures are similar enough to the prerevolutionary bookplate that the card-makers’ Parisian customers would have recognized the manufacturer. But the gifts the kings bear are de-emphasized, and their crowns have been replaced by turbans.  The flap at the top of the envelope labels them as “moors,” not kings.  And the text at the bottom informs consumers that the cards in the wrapper were manufactured by “Citizen” Chassonnier."

                "text": "Other card-makers engraved more overtly revolutionary images and slogans on their card wrappers. On the left, a wrapper printed by the Lyonnais card-maker Manus also features a celestial body in the upper-right hand corner of the main panel, in this case the sun, with the egalitarian legend “Je luit pour tous.”  (I shine for all.). A seated female allegory, prominently featured, gazes at a ship on the horizon, raising her arm in a salute to the idea of hope (“A LESPERANCE”).  The wrapper on the right, created by the Grenoblois card-makers Cheminade and Repellin, repeats the “sun shines for all” motto on the side flaps of the envelope. In the center panel a cartouche featuring an ancient Roman fasces and a phrygian bonnet is encircled by the words “REPUBLIQUE FRANCAISE.”  The labels “LIBERTE” and “EGALITE” are printed above.  Consumers would have readily recognized the republican sympathies of both card-makers."

                "text": "These two examples, from the first decade of the nineteenth century, display designs that eschew both Old Regime royal patronage and Revolutionary ideological concerns.  The envelope on the left, designed to package a deck of Gatteaux cards around 1810-1815, features two winged, classicizing angels sounding their horns.  (On the Gatteaux deck, see the card “<1>fronts</1>” page on this site.)  Between them they support a small cartouche that contains the symbols of the four card suits.  On the right, the envelope printed by the Widon Delatre, a Parisian card-maker, also has a relatively simple cartouche evoking the biblical King Solomon. To his left and right, cornucopias overflow with playing cards, while the flap below records the manufacturer’s shop in a plain typeface.  While the iconography of both wrappers references classical and biblical imagery, it also reproduces images of card suits and card decks that would have been familiar to gamblers in the period."

Our database contains images and data from 24 decks of cards created during this period. The accompanying search tool allows users to search these images by filtering for time period, face card, suit, town, maker, and the fronts and backs of the cards. Users can thus customize comparisons of French face card iconography during the 1644-1848 time period."
