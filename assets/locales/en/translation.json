        "about_initial_blurb_1": "The iconography, taxation, manufacture and uses of playing cards in France  underwent substantial changes from 1650 to 1850. By the 1780s, an “Old  Regime” deck of cards had emerged, characterized by the standardization of  face cards, the state's increasing efforts to extract tax revenue from their  producers, their manufacture via the guild system, and the gaming and non-gaming uses  the kings subjects made of new and used decks of cards. The Revolution of 1789, however, temporarily eliminated the card-makers guild and the excise tax levied on cards, and mandated the suppression of kings, queens, and jacks on face cards. By the time of the Directory in the late 1790s, and even more so during the First Empire, Old Regime practices crept back into the design, taxation, and uses of playing cards. At the same time, the technologies of production evolved and the industry consolidated from dozens of manufacturers around the kingdom to a half dozen or so firms. The history of playing cards over these two centuries offers insight into questions of rupture and continuity in French politics, culture, and economics across the revolutionary divide.",

        "manufacture_1": "The image above, painted to decorate a hand fan, depicts a lively, chaotic scene in a card-maker’s shop on the Ile de la Cité in Paris overlooking the Pont Neuf and the Seine River at the end of the seventeenth century. Some workers create the paper stock on which the cards are printed, while others paint the cards and then cut and sort them into decks. Shopkeepers sell finished decks to well-appointed customers, while cats and dogs cavort in the foreground among the discards from the manufacturing process. Although the shop looks disorderly, the steps involved in making commercial playing cards were well thought-out and efficient. Thanks to two later, detailed discussions of the process, we have a good idea of how most playing cards in France were made before the French Revolution.",

Guildsmen combined three different types of paper into a composite that absorbed the paint used to decorate the cards, but also created enough flexibility that users could shuffle the cards without bending them. In the figure above, we see two workers on the left using a furnace to fabricate the glue that will bind the three different paper stocks together, while the figure on the right stirs the heated glue in preparation for joining the three layers of paper together.",
