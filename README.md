# French Playing Cards

Access the website at https://frenchplayingcards.mit.edu/.

From 1650 to 1850, the French spread enlightenment, gained and lost one empire and began another, and overthrew a centuries-old monarchy. They also played card games. This site explores the history of French playing cards in this period as an unusual and insightful source for the history of the Old Regime, the French Revolution, and early Nineteenth-Century France. You will find details about manufacturing procedures, the material aspects of the playing cards, and the changing iconography of French face cards. A bibliography provides suggestions for further reading. And for those of you interested in gaming, we will offer the opportunity to play a few of the most popular card games of the period, using the historical deck of cards of your choice!
