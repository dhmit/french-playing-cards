                This web site is one outcome of a larger project by <a href="https://history.mit.edu/people/jeffrey-s-ravel/">Jeffrey Ravel</a>, Professor of History at MIT, to write this history.  At a later date, we hope to add a feature that will allow users to play popular Old Regime and Revolutionary card games online, selecting the historical deck with which they will play.
